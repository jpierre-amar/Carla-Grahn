      "title": "About the Artist",
      "description1": "Originally from Seattle, now based in La Creuse, France, I create sculptures and functional art pieces that explore the relationship between natural forms and human-made structures.

    "title": "About",
    "bio1": "I am a sculptor and artist, originally from Seattle, now based in La Creuse, France, working primarily with wood, metal, and stone. My practice spans three interrelated areas: sculptural works, functional furniture, and site-specific commissions.",

    "bio3": "With over twenty years of experience, I have exhibited in galleries and museums throughout Scandinavia and Europe, and have completed numerous public and private commissions. My furniture pieces can be found in homes and collections internationally.",
    "philosophy": {
      "title": "Philosophy",
      "quote": "I believe that sculpture, at its best, creates a pause—a moment where the viewer is invited to see familiar materials transformed into something unexpected. I strive to honor both the history of the material and its potential for new forms."

    "philosophy": {
      "title": "Function & Form",
      "description1": "My furniture pieces are born from the same creative impulse as my sculptures, but with an additional dimension: they must be lived with, touched, used daily.",
      "description2": "This constraint becomes an opportunity to explore how sculptural forms can enhance everyday moments—a table that invites gathering, a chair that embraces the body, a shelf that displays not just objects but memories.",
